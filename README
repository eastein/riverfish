ABOUT

Riverfish is a library for transactional memory-like operations over a sets of ordered integer non-unique keyed data
with restricted and expected key range and restricted operations.  It can be backed by any memcached-protocol
key/value store that supports a certain base set of operations correctly:

* get/set
* gets/cas
* add/delete

STATUS

Riverfish is in pre-release and is not ready for use.

TESTING

To run the test suite, you will need to have a memcached server running on localhost that you are OK with arbitrary
operations being performed on.

Suggested test run command:

	nosetests -v test
